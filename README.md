# JamWare Skate Shop! 

*Welcome to my skate shop!* 
Here is the UI component for modelling a skateboard API I built. My plan is to continually add to this collection and build a responsive, beautful, front-end that is designed to look like a store counter. For now though, a relatively basic form and some pretty text will have to do.

Functional Requirements

**01	Create**	The web page will display a form and include all the inputs to create a new item. If any required fields are left blank when submitting the form, the web page will display an appropriate error message(s) to the user. After the form is submitted successfully, the web page will re-direct the user to the home page. The newly created item will appear in the list of items on the home page.

**02	Home**	The home page will display all items in the collection. This will include a small to medium size image of the item and all the additional fields. 

The homepage will include a header with a title/logo. Include a “Create” or “Add New” button/link on the homepage. Included with each item in the list, display buttons/links for “delete” and “update”. The buttons/links will go to the corresponding web page.

**03	Update**	The web page will display all the fields to update an existing item by id. The form fields will be pre-populated with the item’s existing data. The image will also be displayed for the item. If any required fields are left blank when submitting the form, the web page will display an appropriate error message to the user. After the form is submitted successfully, the web page will re-direct the user to the home page. Any changes made to the item will be visible when viewing the item on the homepage.

Selecting an image file is optional when updating an item. If no file is selected when completing the form, the item’s original image should remain. If a new image file is selected, then the newly chosen image should display with the item now.

**04	Delete**	The web page will display the existing item’s name/title and image. A question will display to ask the user to confirm to delete the item (e.g., “are you sure you want to delete this item?”). There will be a button to confirm the deletion, and a cancel button that just returns the user to the home page. If the user chooses to delete the item, the user is re-directed to the homepage and the deleted item will no longer appear in the list of items on the homepage.
